## [1.4.1] – 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Request History dropdown** on URL bar — tap the 🕒 icon to load any of the last 10 sent URLs instantly.
- **Sticky URL bar + Send button** — moved into the AppBar's `bottom` slot so they stay visible while scrolling through tabs.
- **Duplicate Request** — long-press any saved request in Collections to get a context menu with Duplicate and Delete options.
- **Re-run ↺ button** — each failed or pending request in the Collection Runner now shows a re-run button to retry individually without re-running the whole collection.
- **X / Y progress counter** — Collection Runner shows "3 / 10 requests completed" while running.
- **Persist last run summary** — Collection Runner results survive navigation; opening the runner again shows the last result instead of auto-re-running.
- **Empty state hints** in Params and Headers tabs — shows `ℹ No params yet — tap + to add` when the list is empty.
- **Documentation link** in Settings → About section — opens `devpocket.gitbook.io` in the browser.
- **GitBook badge** added to `README.md`.

### Fixed
- `CollectionModel` type reference error in `runner_screen.dart` initState — replaced with a plain `for` loop lookup.
- `String?` nullable `collectionId` passed to `saveToCollection(String)` — guarded with early `null` return.
- `RequestModel.copyWith(id:)` — `id` is not in `copyWith`; switched to full `RequestModel(...)` constructor for duplication.

## [1.4.0] – 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Terminal (DevShell)**: Real Termux-like Android Linux terminal using `Process.start('sh', ['-c', cmd])`.
  - Live `stdout` / `stderr` streaming with color coding.
  - Real `cd` with persistent working directory tracking.
  - `Ctrl+C` kill button for running processes.
  - Command history (↑/↓ navigation).
  - Multi-session tabbed support.
  - Quick-command toolbar (`ls -la`, `ping`, `curl`, `df -h`, `ip addr`, etc.).
- **HTML Preview**: Response Viewer now renders HTML responses using `flutter_widget_from_html_core`.
  - JSON responses get pretty-printed with syntax color.
  - Fallback plain-text view with copy button for all other types.

### Fixed
- **API Tester Params/Headers Tab** — Completely replaced `DefaultTabController` + `TabBarView` with a custom `IndexedStack` approach, eliminating the internal `Material` white-background override.
- **HeadersEditor `LateInitializationError`** — Changed `late List` vars to eagerly-initialized lists with a `_controllersInitialized` boolean guard, fixing the silent crash that caused blank Params/Headers tabs.
- **HeadersEditor width** — Wrapped root column in `SizedBox(width: double.infinity)` to force full-width layout even when the pairs map is empty.

## [1.3.0] – 2026-02-28 — Postman-Level Pro Update

### Added

- **Bi-directional URL & Params Sync**: Editing the URL updates the Params table and vice versa in real time.
- **Auth Engine**: Full Bearer token, Basic Auth, and API Key support. Postman collections with `auth` blocks are now parsed correctly.
- **Collection Runner v2**: Expandable result tiles showing full response body and headers per request.
- **"Clear Results" button** in Collection Runner.
- **Response Preview tab**: Renders HTML/JSON/text responses inline.
- **GitBook-style Documentation v2.0**: Chunked, searchable docs with deep linking.

### Changed
- API Tester layout refactored to high-density "Request Control Center".

### Fixed
- Build errors in `runner_screen.dart` (class nesting, orphaned methods, missing context refs).

## [1.2.6] – 2026-02 — Full HTTP Support

### Fixed
